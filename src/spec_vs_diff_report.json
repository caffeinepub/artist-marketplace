  "summary": "The diff implements both requirements: REQ-21 adds the useIsStripeConfigured query hook (though getUserStripeConfig is not explicitly shown in the truncated useQueries.ts), and REQ-20 updates CreateItemForm to check Stripe configuration and display a guidance message with a Settings link when not configured. However, the diff is heavily truncated, limiting full verification of all acceptance criteria.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "New React Query hook getUserStripeConfig is created that calls the backend getUserStripeConfig method",
      "reason": "The diff shows useIsStripeConfigured hook being imported and used in CreateItemForm, but the truncated useQueries.ts file does not show the implementation of getUserStripeConfig. The hook name differs from the specified getUserStripeConfig, though it may be a wrapper. Cannot verify the hook calls the backend getUserStripeConfig method as specified.",
