  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses most requirements for adding artist profile creation with Stripe configuration. All backend changes (User type with isArtist field, updateArtistStatus mutation, user-scoped Stripe storage) and frontend changes (Settings page, Header navigation, artist status hooks, CreateItemForm checks) are present. However, the diff summary is truncated, limiting verification of complete implementation details for Stripe configuration scoping and payment processing updates.",
